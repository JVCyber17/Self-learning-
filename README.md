# Self-learning
This repository showcases my hands-on ability to apply security concepts through scripting and tool development. My focus is on creating practical, analyst-ready solutions.

🚀 Practical Projects

1. Log-Hunter (Python Log Analyzer)

A command-line tool written in Python for security log analysis. It automates the detection of common web attack patterns within server access logs.

Functionality: Reads access.log files and uses Regular Expressions (Regex) to flag malicious requests, including:

SQL Injection attempts

Directory Traversal payloads

Known Vulnerability Scanner signatures

Output: Generates a structured report detailing suspicious lines and summarizing the Top Attacker IP Addresses by count.
